# ETH201-Openzepplin-Assignment

This assignment is to create a new ERC20 token contract, AssignToken.sol under “contracts”,  from the Openzeppelin template ERC20PresetMinterPauser and add cap functionality. Meaning that there is a maximum cap of token issuance. 

A new function that allows me to modify the cap is also built.

I also study the AccessControl contract from Openzeppelin and implement a new role in the same ERC20 contract. This role should be the only one to be able to change the contract’s cap.
